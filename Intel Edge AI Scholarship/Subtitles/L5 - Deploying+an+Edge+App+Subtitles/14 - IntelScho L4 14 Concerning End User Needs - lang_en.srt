00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,795
Before we close out this lesson and the course,

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:09,105
I want to add a final note on considering the needs of your applications end users.

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:11,040
If you're building an app for

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,075
certain end users it's very important to consider their needs.

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,240
Knowing their needs can inform the various trade offs you

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,450
make regarding model decisions such as speed,

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,055
size and accuracy as well as what information you send the servers,

8
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:28,965
security of information etc.

9
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:31,550
If they have more resources available,

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,810
you might go for a higher accuracy but more resource intensive apps.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,860
On end-user with remote low-power devices will likely

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,045
have to sacrifice some accuracy for a lighter faster application.

13
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:48,035
They'll also need some additional considerations about network usage.

14
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,420
This is just to get you thinking.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,220
Building edge applications is about more than just models and code.
