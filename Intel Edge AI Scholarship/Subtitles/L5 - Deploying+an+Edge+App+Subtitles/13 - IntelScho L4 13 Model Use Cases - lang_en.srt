1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,535
Throughout the course, we've hit a lot on different use cases for edge applications.

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:07,305
It's important to think on

3
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:11,445
any additional use cases for a given model or application you build.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:16,275
These can go far beyond the original training set or intended use.

5
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:21,735
For example, object detection can be used for so many different things.

6
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:27,525
If a given model is mainly focused on particular classes along with some post-processing,

7
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:30,945
there can be very different applications to come from it.

8
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:34,470
As another example, think of pose detection.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,400
It's useful for video games such as dancing,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,790
motion capture, and tracking movement,

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,850
exercise applications, and even health applications,

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,190
noting posture or even that something could be

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,040
wrong are additional use cases that can be used here.
