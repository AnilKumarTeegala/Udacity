00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,455
Moving on from the basics of MQTT and publish-subscribe,

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:08,370
I want to show you how to work with MQTT in Python.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,190
There's a useful Python library for working with MQTT called paho-mqtt.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,105
Within, there's a sub library called client,

5
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,520
which as you may guess is how you create

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,050
the MQTT client that can publish or subscribe to the broker.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,165
Now, you'll need to know the IP address of the broker as well as setting the port for it.

8
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:33,840
With those, you can then connect to the client and from

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,770
there you can either publish or subscribe to different topics.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,180
Publishing involves feeding in the topic name as well as

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,005
a dictionary containing the message that is dumped to JSON.

12
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:49,565
Subscribing just involves feeding in the topic name to be subscribed to.

13
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,590
At the bottom of the page,

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,380
I've linked the documentation for this library.

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,990
You can use it to answer the quiz below on

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,530
the proper syntax for publishing and subscribing in Python.

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,560
You also get to use it in a later exercise for

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,815
after we've covered streaming videos to servers as well.

19
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:08,900
Before we move on,

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,070
it's important to remember

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,295
your Python MQTT client is actually sending this message to a broker server first.

22
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:21,550
So if you wanted to view data from your Python app on a web page somewhere,

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,080
that web page would actually include code to

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,620
subscribe to the server not your Python client.

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,400
Later in this lesson,

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,350
we'll show you how a Node server can be used to accomplish this.

27
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,030
In fact, in the project you will end up with two nodes servers.

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,780
One that acts as the MQTT server and

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,950
one that subscribes to that server and actually publishes a web page.

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,075
Most of the specifics of that are outside the scope of the course.

31
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:54,650
So these servers will be given to you to interact with from your Python application.

32
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,250
Next, let's look at streaming video to a server.

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,120
The other thing that final Node server will be able to receive.
