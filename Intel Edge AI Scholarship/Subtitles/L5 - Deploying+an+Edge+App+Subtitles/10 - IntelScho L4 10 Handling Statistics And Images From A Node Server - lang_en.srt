00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,645
So far I've mentioned node servers a few times.

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:06,900
So let's briefly cover what exactly these are.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,250
Node.js is an open source environment for servers,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,670
where JavaScript can be run outside of a browser.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,715
Think about a social media page for instance,

6
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:22,010
that page is going to contain different content for each different user,

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,585
based on their social network.

8
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:27,500
Node allows for JavaScript to run outside of the browser to gather

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,585
the various relevant post for each given user and then send those posts to the browser.

10
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:38,465
In our case, a node server can be used to handle the data coming in from the MQTT

11
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:44,960
and FFmpeg servers and then actually render that content for a webpage user interface.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,650
In the upcoming exercise as well as in the project,

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,900
you'll be given the main Node servers;

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,235
one for the UI and one for the MQTT server.

15
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:59,555
It will be your job to communicate with them from the Python app.

16
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,780
Note that you can also utilize a more basic front-end

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,050
with HTML and CSS for a web page like this.

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,415
But these type of front-end skills are outside the scope of this course.

19
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:12,770
Using these type of servers though,

20
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,970
is closer to a more end-to-end piece for the Internet of Things.

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,280
So you've built out your app but what

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,265
happens to the information you processed at the edge?

23
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:27,480
Someone or something probably wants to receive that data.
