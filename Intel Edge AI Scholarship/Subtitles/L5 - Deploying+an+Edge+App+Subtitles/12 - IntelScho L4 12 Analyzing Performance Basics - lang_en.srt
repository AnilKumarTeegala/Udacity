00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
We're now through the programming parts of this lesson,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,395
and to finish things off,

3
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:08,130
I want to cover some more discussion-based and analytical topics.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,130
We've talked a lot about optimizing for inference,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,855
and running apps at the edge.

6
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:18,180
But it's always important to not skip past the accuracy of your edge AI Model.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,900
Lighter, quicker models are helpful for the edge,

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,630
and certain optimizations like lower precision that

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,870
help with these will have some impact on accuracy.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,950
No amount of skillful post-processing and attempting to extract

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,955
useful data from the output will make up for a poor model choice,

12
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:39,920
or one where too many sacrifices were made for speed.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,200
Of course, it all depends on

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,670
the exact application as to how much loss of accuracy is acceptable.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,250
Detecting a pet gain into the trash

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,975
likely can handle less accuracy than a self-driving car.

17
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:56,210
Now, the considerations of speed, size,

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,890
and network impacts are still very important for AI at the edge.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,270
Faster models can free up computation for other tests.

20
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,475
They can lead to less power usage,

21
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:10,685
and allow for the use of cheaper hardware.

22
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:14,630
Smaller models can also free up memory for other tasks,

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,645
or allow for devices with less memory to begin with.

24
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,965
We've also discussed some of the network impacts earlier on.

25
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,875
Especially for remote edge devices,

26
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:29,645
the power cost of heavy network communication may significantly hamper their use.

27
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:34,340
Lastly, there can be other differences in Cloud versus edge costs,

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,470
other than just network effects.

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,260
While potentially being lower up front,

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,190
cloud storage and computation costs can add up over time.

31
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,425
As we discussed earlier on,

32
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:48,940
data sent the cloud could be intercepted along the way.

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,580
Although, this does depend on a secure edge device,

34
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,520
which is not always the case for the internet of things.
