1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,055
It's great to have you back.

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:05,220
In the final exercise at the last lesson you

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,315
integrated everything you've learned so far into an Edge Application.

4
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:12,480
That app switched us from just images to using

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,735
videos as well as creating an output video.

6
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:18,855
However, what about using Webcam inputs,

7
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:20,730
or instead streaming information,

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,195
or the output video itself somewhere over the Internet.

9
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,800
In this lesson, we'll cover some crucial topics to do

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,640
so including some more basics of OpenCV,

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,655
handling input streams in OpenCV,

12
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:38,330
processing model outputs for additional useful information,

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,185
the basics of MQTT,

14
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,015
and its use with Internet of Things devices,

15
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:49,070
sending statistics and video streams to a server, performance basics,

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,260
and then we'll finish up by thinking about

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,390
additional model use cases as well as some end user needs. Let's get started.
