1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
You've made it through a ton of OpenVINO Toolkit fundamentals.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,235
Now, it's time to integrate everything into an application.

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:12,225
Coming up, we will be converting a model with the model optimizer,

4
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:14,475
loading it with the inference engine,

5
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:18,060
adding any necessary pre-processing steps for the input frame,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,955
making inference requests and performing inference,

7
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:23,415
and handling and processing the outputs.

8
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:27,345
Of course, we'll make sure all of this gets built into an application.

9
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:28,965
That sounds like a lot.

10
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:31,560
But you actually know how to do all of this already.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,550
I'm throwing in a couple of extra steps that go on

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,955
top of just the OpenVINO Toolkit pieces as well.

13
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,940
But we'll go ahead and use some of your inference outputs.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,580
But first, is to add functionality

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,490
for different confidence thresholds to determine when to drop

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,610
bounding boxes for the output and the other is

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,180
adding functionality for different colors of the bounding boxes themselves.

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,045
By the end of the exercise,

19
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:58,760
you've fully integrated the inference engine into the app as

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,065
well as having some additional customization available for the apps output.

21
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,630
Good luck and I'll see you back here soon.
