00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
In this lesson, we've covered the basics of the inference engine, the supported devices,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,420
feeding an intermediate representation to the inference engine,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,580
as well as making inference request,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,520
and then handling the results from the inference engine.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,290
You finished up by integrating the inference engine into an application.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,050
Next up, we'll take a step back from

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,480
the OpenVINO Toolkit and look into some additional topics useful for edge applications.
